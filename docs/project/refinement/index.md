# Refinement Workbench

This index is the canonical project record for Refinement Story and Change Request
backlog status. Linked documents preserve context and evidence; they do not own status.
If a linked document and this index disagree, this index wins.

## Current Focus

- Refinement Story: none
- Change Request: none

Selecting a focus is an explicit project decision. Reading this file never selects or
executes work.

## Refinement Stories

| Order | ID | Story | Status |
|------:|----|-------|--------|
| 1 | [RS001](rs001-ariad-runtime-trust/index.md) | Ariad Runtime Trust | active |
| 2 | [RS002](rs002-collaborative-refinement-work/index.md) | Collaborative Refinement Work | closed |
| 3 | [RS003](rs003-revisable-refinement-lifecycle/index.md) | Revisable Refinement Lifecycle | proposed |
| 4 | [RS004](rs004-identity-resolution-fidelity/index.md) | Identity Resolution Fidelity | proposed |

## Change Requests

Open work is ordered intentionally. Terminal history follows open work.

## Status Vocabulary

Refinement Story:

```text
proposed | active | parked | closed
```

Change Request:

```text
captured | planned | in_progress | blocked | validated | done | parked | rejected | promoted
```

Detailed phase history belongs in the CR document. The index records only the current
canonical status.

## Collaboration Convention

The full contributor route is the
[Collaborative Refinement Protocol](rs002-collaborative-refinement-work/collaboration-protocol.md).

- `Driver` names one accountable human contributor, preferably by GitHub handle. It
  never names a Mirror persona, journey, runtime session, or database identity.
- `Delivery` is a pull request link when one exists, otherwise a backticked Git branch.
  It never contains an absolute path, local worktree, conversation ID, or journey UUID.
- The canonical empty value is `—`. A `captured` or `planned` CR may be unassigned.
- An `in_progress`, `blocked`, or `validated` CR must record both Driver and Delivery.
- Assignment and reassignment are explicit Navigator decisions. Mirror never infers
  ownership from the current checkout, latest committer, or private runtime state.
- When a pull request opens, replace the branch reference with its PR link.
- Terminal history keeps Driver and Delivery as provenance. Stale work is never
  reassigned automatically; the Navigator decides whether to keep, reassign, block, or
  park it.

## Artifact Convention

- IDs are stable, project-wide `RSNNN` and `CRNNN` identifiers.
- IDs are allocated at publication, never while drafting. A draft carries a slug; the
  number, the canonical row, and the push to origin happen as one act.
- IDs do not encode a journey, database, person, absolute path, or runtime display code.
- Existing database display codes are not imported and do not define these IDs.
- Each RS owns one directory and one `index.md`.
- Each CR is one evolving Markdown document inside its RS directory.
- Separate `artifacts/` files are optional and exist only when they add information.
- Empty files for lifecycle phases are not created.
- Git owns history, collaboration, conflict resolution, and recovery.
- No document grants commit, push, merge, publication, or release authority.
